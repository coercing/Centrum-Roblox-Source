<h1>[ how to use tutorial ]</h1>

### 1. Close / Download the repo

</div>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coercing/Centrum-Roblox-Source/
cd Centrum-Roblox-Source or open within file explorer!
```

<div align="center">

### 2. Open the .sln and run via Release!

</div>

```bash
Make sure youve got all of the dependencies and the include paths correct too!
```

<div align="center">

### 3. Build and run!

</div>

```bash
Remember to update the offsets! I believe this project is heavily out of date and the hyperion anticheat massively grows and becomes more advanced
I would NOT consider this to be a good cheat to simply compile as this source code has been public for a long time and a lot of advancements have been made to hyperion since
